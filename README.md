# LootMarshal

LootMarshal is an API server used to manage storage of credentials and files. Pentesters and Red Teamers tend to organize credentials and files of interesting in a variety of ways and LootMarshal aims to help keep testers organized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8

### Installing

LootMarshal is written in a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) environment. However, poetry is not required to install LootMarshal. You may use pip>=19.0 to install with the `pyproject.toml` file. It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you install this tool in a virtual environment.

**Poetry:** `poetry install`

**Pipenv:** `pipenv install .`

**Pip:** `pip install .`

## Usage

LootMarshal is provided as two parts: Server and CLI. While the CLI provided will be kept up to parity with server functions, you are free to implement your own CLI to interact with the server in any manner you'd like.

### Implement your backend handler
Currently, the available backends available for LootMarshal are:

- Azure

**Azure**

1. Create credentials for LootMarshal to use. LootMarshal can only be configured to run with a Service Principal client ID and secret (more credential types may be supported in the future). **Maintain the credentials as a secret!**
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal


2. Create a Key Vault and Storage account. Provide appropriate permissions to the resources for the Service Principal. (Contributor access to the vault and storage account only is sufficient).

Key Vault: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview-security<br>
Storage: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal


### Configure settings

Before running LootMarshal, you must configure the settings for the server to use. These settings can be found in the `lootmarshal/settings/settings.env` file. 

### Launch the server

```
‚ùØ py .\lm.py server
